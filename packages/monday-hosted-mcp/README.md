### For Local Development

- Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root with:

```
MONDAY_CLIENT_ID=your_development_monday_client_id
MONDAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_development_monday_client_secret
```

#### Develop & Test

Run the server locally to make it available at `http://localhost:8799`
`wrangler dev`

To test the local server, enter `http://localhost:8799/sse` into Inspector and hit connect. Once you follow the prompts, you'll be able to "List Tools".

#### Using Claude and other MCP Clients

When using Claude to connect to your remote MCP server, you may see some error messages. This is because Claude Desktop doesn't yet support remote MCP servers, so it sometimes gets confused. To verify whether the MCP server is connected, hover over the ðŸ”¨ icon in the bottom right corner of Claude's interface. You should see your tools available there.

#### Using Cursor and other MCP Clients

To connect Cursor with your MCP server, choose `Type`: "Command" and in the `Command` field, combine the command and args fields into one (e.g. `npx mcp-remote https://<your-worker-name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse`).

Note that while Cursor supports HTTP+SSE servers, it doesn't support authentication, so you still need to use `mcp-remote` (and to use a STDIO server, not an HTTP one).

You can connect your MCP server to other MCP clients like Windsurf by opening the client's configuration file, adding the same JSON that was used for the Claude setup, and restarting the MCP client.

## How does it work?

#### OAuth Provider

The OAuth Provider library serves as a complete OAuth 2.1 server implementation for Cloudflare Workers. It handles the complexities of the OAuth flow, including token issuance, validation, and management. In this project, it plays the dual role of:

- Authenticating MCP clients that connect to your server
- Managing the connection to monday's OAuth services
- Securely storing tokens and authentication state in KV storage

#### Durable MCP

Durable MCP extends the base MCP functionality with Cloudflare's Durable Objects, providing:

- Persistent state management for your MCP server
- Secure storage of authentication context between requests
- Access to authenticated user information via `this.props`
- Support for conditional tool availability based on user identity

#### MCP Remote

The MCP Remote library enables your server to expose tools that can be invoked by MCP clients like the Inspector. It:

- Defines the protocol for communication between clients and your server
- Provides a structured way to define tools
- Handles serialization and deserialization of requests and responses
- Maintains the Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection between clients and your server
