## ‚ö° **Recommended action items**

-  **Conduct a retrospective focused on task removal reasons**: With 16 tasks removed this sprint, it is crucial to understand why these tasks were not completed. A dedicated retrospective session could help identify patterns and prevent similar issues in future sprints.


-  **Enhance collaboration between roles**: The sprint involved multiple roles (Dev, Design, Product), and improving collaboration could streamline processes. For instance, regular check-ins between designers and developers could help ensure that design tasks are not blocked.


-  **Implement a daily stand-up to address blockers**: Given the number of tasks that were 'Blocked' or 'On Hold', a daily stand-up could help the team quickly identify and address blockers, ensuring smoother progress throughout the sprint.


-  **Reduce the number of unplanned tasks in the next sprint**: With 41 unplanned tasks this sprint, the team should analyze the causes of these unplanned tasks and implement strategies to minimize them. For example, conducting a pre-sprint planning session to identify potential risks could help.


-  **Review and adjust the sprint planning process**: The high number of planned tasks (94) versus completed tasks (66) suggests that the planning process may need adjustment. The team should consider reducing the number of planned tasks to a more manageable level based on past performance.


-  **Prioritize high-impact tasks more effectively**: Several critical tasks were completed, but the high number of unplanned tasks suggests that prioritization may have been lacking. The team should adopt a prioritization framework to ensure that the most impactful tasks are addressed first.


-  **Improve task estimation accuracy**: The team completed only 66 out of 90 committed tasks, indicating a gap in estimation. Team members should review past sprints to refine their estimation techniques, possibly using historical data to inform future commitments.
